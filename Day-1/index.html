            <h2>Academic Background</h2>
            <p>
                I am a first-year undergraduate student in the Electronics and
                Communication Engineering department at NIT Raipur. Alongside
                my core subjects, I am actively exploring coding and web
                development as areas of interest.

            <p>
                As an intern, I worked in a collaborative team environment where
                I learned discipline, task management, and the importance of
                structured problem-solving, skills that are equally valuable
                in coding projects.
            </p>

                improving coordination, communication, and teamwork skills.
